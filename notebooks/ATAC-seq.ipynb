    "ATAC-seq is an assay that captures accessible chromatin first described in [Buenrostro et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2688), and it stands for Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing. It has become a popular assay because of its advantages over previous assays (DNAseI-seq and FAIRE-seq), such as the relatively easy protocol and low cellular input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover:\n",
    "* Processing ATAC-seq data\n",
    "* High level summary using gene ontology\n",
    "* Finding enriched transcription factor motifs\n",
    "* Visualizing results on the UCSC genome browser\n",

    "Unlike something like ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq is typically not run with a control due to the limited information obtained. ATAC-seq is typically sequenced with paired-end sequencing for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* More sequence data leads to better alignment results. Many genomes contain numerous repetitive elements, and failing to align reads to certain genomic regions unambiguously renders those regions inaccessible to the assay. \n",
    "\n",
    "* With ATAC-seq, we are interested in knowing the full span of the DNA fragments generated by the assay. A DNA fragment generated by the ATAC is typically longer than a sequence read, so a read will define only one end of the fragment. Therefore, with single-end sequencing, we would have to guess where the other end of the fragment is. Since paired-end sequencing generates reads from both ends, the full span of the DNA fragment is known precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "* PCR duplicates are identified more accurately. PCR duplicates are artifacts of the ATAC-seq procedure, and they should be removed as part of the analysis pipeline. However, computational programs that remove PCR duplicates (e.g. Picard's MarkDuplicates) typically identify duplicates based on comparing ends of aligned reads. \n"

    "Single cell methods enable researchers to capture finer resolution than ever before, and allow pinpointing disease mechanisms and regulatory programs to specific cell types within a bulk tissue sample. The analysis of single cell ATAC-seq is many times more challenging than analyzing single cell RNA-seq, because accessible chromatin is essentially binary at the single-cell level.  \n",
